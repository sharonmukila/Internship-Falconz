     <h1>  <p align="center"><i>Advanced Care for Joints and Bones:</i>  </p></h1>
 
       <h3> <p align="justify">Our orthopedic surgeons use advanced techniques and technology to 
          diagnose and treat injuries and disorders involving joints,bones, muscles,
          ligaments and tendons, such as knee ligament injuries, osteoarthritis, carpal 
          tunnel syndrome, and fractures.We can get you closer to the normal range of 
          motion you once enjoyed and back to the active, independent lifestyle you desire if you are experiencing progressively intense
           chronic pain, together with impairment of daily functions that include walking, climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position, you may want to consider a total hip replacement. Replacement generally is considered only after pain becomes so severe that it impedes normal function despite use of anti-inflammatory medications.
           A total hip joint replacement is an elective procedure, which means that it is an option selected among other alternatives.
          A total knee replacement is generally performed when a person has a severe
          degenerative joint disorder, such as osteoarthritis, in which the moving 
          surfaces of the knee deteriorate. This leads to severe pain, limitation or 
          loss of function,and/or deformity of the joint. Surgery may also be performed 
          to replace a badly fractured knee, or when previous joint replacements have failed
          Bilateral replacement means that  both knees are replaced at the same time</p>   </h3>
